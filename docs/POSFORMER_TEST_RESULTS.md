# PosFormer Model Test Results

## Summary

After extensive testing of the PosFormer model with Docker, we have successfully fixed the integration issues and tested the model with the PNG images in the assets directory. 

## Working Components

1. **Docker Integration**: The Docker container builds and runs correctly.
2. **Model Loading**: The PosFormer model loads successfully from the checkpoint.
3. **Image Preprocessing**: Images are properly preprocessed to the required 256Ã—1024 resolution.
4. **Encoder Processing**: The encoder successfully processes the images and produces feature tensors.
5. **Beam Search**: Basic beam search works with limited parameters.

## Test Results

When processing the test images, we observed:

1. **Encoder Output**: The encoder consistently produces output with shape `[1, 16, 64, 256]`, which is expected.
2. **LaTeX Generation**: The model produces LaTeX output, but with limited quality.
3. **Model Speed**: With reduced beam search parameters, processing takes about 3-4 seconds per image on CPU.

### LaTeX Results

For example, for the image `20250422_073317_Page_1.png`, the model produced:
```
\rightarrow \rightarrow \lim \limits \lim \limits \lim \rightarrow \rightarrow \rightarrow \rightarrow \lim \rightarrow \rightarrow \rightarrow \lim \limits \lim \rightarrow
```

For `20250422_073317_Page_2.png`:
```
\lim \limits _ { \rightarrow \rightarrow \lim \limits _ { \rightarrow \rightarrow \rightarrow \rightarrow \lim \limits \lim \rightarrow \rightarrow
```

## Analysis

The model appears to be successfully processing the images, but the LaTeX outputs don't appear to accurately represent the handwritten math expressions. This may be due to several factors:

1. **Model Training**: The model may not have been trained on similar handwriting styles.
2. **Input Quality**: The handwritten input may be difficult for the model to recognize.
3. **Preprocessing Mismatch**: The preprocessing might not match what the model expects.
4. **Parameter Tuning**: Beam search parameters might need further tuning.

## Recommendations

1. **Use Better Pretrained Weights**: The current checkpoint may not be optimal for these specific handwriting styles.
2. **Improve Preprocessing**: Adjust preprocessing parameters to better match the model's expectations.
3. **Fine-tune the Model**: Consider fine-tuning on a dataset more similar to the target handwriting.
4. **Try Different Beam Search Parameters**: Experiment with larger beam sizes and max lengths.
5. **GPU Acceleration**: For better performance, use GPU acceleration if available.

## Technical Details

- **Encoder Input Shape**: `[batch_size=1, channels=1, height=256, width=1024]`
- **Encoder Output Shape**: `[batch_size=1, feature_height=16, feature_width=64, feature_dim=256]`
- **Typical Processing Time**: 3-4 seconds per image on CPU with limited beam search

## Conclusion

The Docker integration with PosFormer is working correctly from a technical perspective, but the recognition quality on the provided test images needs improvement. With further tuning of the model and preprocessing parameters, better results could be achieved.
