# PosFormer Docker Integration Solution

This document provides a comprehensive solution for integrating the PosFormer model with Docker to recognize handwritten mathematical expressions from PNG files.

## Problem Statement

The PosFormer model integration was facing the following issues:

1. **Model Architecture Mismatch**: The checkpoint structure didn't match the model definition, causing tensor size mismatch errors like `[256, 912, 1, 1]` vs `[256, 684, 1, 1]`.
2. **Python/PyTorch Version Requirements**: PosFormer requires specific versions (Python 3.7, PyTorch 1.8.1, PyTorch Lightning 1.4.9) which caused compatibility issues.
3. **Image Preprocessing**: The PNG files needed specific preprocessing to match the model's expected input format (256×1024 resolution).

## Solution Components

### 1. Docker Environment

The Docker configuration has been refined to ensure the correct dependencies:

- Python 3.7 base image
- PyTorch 1.8.1 and torchvision 0.9.1
- PyTorch Lightning 1.4.9
- NumPy 1.20.0 installed before PyTorch to avoid API conflicts

### 2. Model Architecture Fix

A model patching script (`scripts/model_fix.py`) has been created to:

- Analyze the checkpoint structure at runtime
- Identify the correct tensor dimensions for the feature projection layer
- Patch the model architecture to match the checkpoint structure
- Correctly load weights using `LitPosFormer.load_from_checkpoint()`

### 3. Image Preprocessing Pipeline

The image preprocessing pipeline has been optimized to:

- Convert images to grayscale
- Standardize to the required 256×1024 resolution
- Handle black-on-white format with appropriate binarization
- Preserve aspect ratio during scaling
- Properly center content in the target resolution

### 4. Integration Scripts

Several scripts have been provided to facilitate the integration:

- `run_docker.sh`: Basic script to build and run the Docker container with a test image
- `run_debug.sh`: Diagnostic script that provides detailed information about model loading and tensor issues
- `run_fixed_docker.sh`: Comprehensive solution that:
  1. Builds the Docker container
  2. Runs diagnostics
  3. Applies model architecture fixes
  4. Processes all test images in the assets directory

## Usage Instructions

1. **For basic testing with Docker**:
   ```bash
   ./run_docker.sh
   ```

2. **For diagnosing specific issues**:
   ```bash
   ./run_debug.sh
   ```

3. **For the complete solution (recommended)**:
   ```bash
   ./run_fixed_docker.sh
   ```

## Technical Details

### Model Loading Fix

The key issue was in the feature projection layer dimensions:

```python
# Original model (incorrect):
self.feature_proj = torch.nn.Conv2d(684, 256, kernel_size=1)

# Checkpoint expected (correct):
self.feature_proj = torch.nn.Conv2d(912, 256, kernel_size=1)
```

Our solution dynamically patches this during runtime by:

1. Examining the checkpoint to determine the correct dimensions
2. Creating a patched Encoder class with the correct dimensions
3. Monkey-patching the original Encoder class to use these dimensions

### Image Preprocessing

Images are preprocessed to the exact format expected by PosFormer:

1. Convert to grayscale (if not already)
2. Standardize to 256×1024 pixels (height × width)
3. Ensure black ink (0) on white paper (255)
4. Process using OpenCV for maximum performance

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Run `./run_debug.sh` to get detailed diagnostic information
2. Check the Docker build logs for dependency issues
3. Ensure the checkpoint file exists at the expected location
4. Verify that the PNG files are accessible inside the Docker container

## Future Improvements

1. Create a custom Docker image with the patched model pre-built
2. Implement caching for processed images to improve performance
3. Add support for real-time handwriting recognition from the Supernote device
