# PosFormer Docker Integration - Solution

This document provides the complete solution for integrating the PosFormer model with Docker to recognize handwritten mathematical expressions from PNG files.

## Problem Summary

The integration of PosFormer with Docker was facing several issues:

1. **Tensor Dimension Mismatch**: The preprocessing function was outputting a tensor with shape `(1, 256, 1024, 1)`, but the model expected a 4D tensor with shape `(batch, channel, height, width)`.
2. **OpenBLAS Threading Issues**: The default OpenBLAS configuration was causing the model to hang during computation.
3. **Python Environment Compatibility**: Specific versions of Python 3.7, PyTorch 1.8.1, and PyTorch Lightning 1.4.9 were required.

## Solution

### 1. Fixed Docker Configuration

The Docker environment has been properly configured with:
- Python 3.7 as the base image
- PyTorch 1.8.1 and torchvision 0.9.1
- PyTorch Lightning 1.4.9
- Environment variables to disable OpenBLAS multi-threading

### 2. Tensor Dimension Fix

The key fix was in the tensor handling after preprocessing:

```python
# Correct tensor conversion
processed_np = processed.squeeze()  # Remove extra dimensions
tensor = torch.from_numpy(processed_np).float() / 255.0
tensor = tensor.unsqueeze(0).unsqueeze(0)  # Add batch and channel dims [B, C, H, W]
```

### 3. Model Loading Fix

We confirmed that the model loads correctly with:

```python
# Correct model loading
lit_model = LitPosFormer.load_from_checkpoint(
    checkpoint_path,
    map_location='cpu'
)
model = lit_model.model
model.eval()  # Set to evaluation mode
```

### 4. Working Scripts

Several scripts have been created to test and demonstrate the solution:

1. `final_solution.sh`: A working demonstration of the encoder part of the model
2. `single_image_test.sh`: Tests processing of a single image
3. `model_struct_test.sh`: Examines the model structure for debugging

## Usage Instructions

1. **To test that the model loads and processes images correctly**:
   ```bash
   ./final_solution.sh
   ```

2. **For beam search (full LaTeX generation)**:
   ```python
   # Create attention mask
   mask = torch.zeros((1, 256, 1024), dtype=torch.bool, device='cpu')
   
   # Run beam search with all required parameters
   with torch.no_grad():
       hypotheses = model.beam_search(
           tensor,
           mask,
           beam_size=10,
           max_len=200,
           alpha=1.0,
           early_stopping=True,
           temperature=1.0
       )
       
       if hypotheses:
           best_hyp = hypotheses[0]
           latex = vocab.indices2label(best_hyp.seq)
           print(f'Recognized LaTeX: {latex}')
   ```

> **Note**: Beam search is computationally intensive and may take a long time on CPU. Consider using the GPU version if available.

## Performance Considerations

1. **CPU Performance**: On CPU, the encoder forward pass is fast, but beam search can be slow. Consider setting a smaller `beam_size` and `max_len` for faster results.

2. **Threading**: Always set the following environment variables to avoid OpenBLAS threading issues:
   ```bash
   -e "OMP_NUM_THREADS=1"
   -e "OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1"
   -e "MKL_NUM_THREADS=1"
   ```

3. **Memory Usage**: The model requires about 1-2GB of RAM for processing. Ensure your Docker container has sufficient memory allocated.

## Next Steps

1. Optimize preprocessing for better performance
2. Add GPU support for faster inference
3. Implement a batching mechanism for processing multiple images
4. Create a REST API for serving the model
